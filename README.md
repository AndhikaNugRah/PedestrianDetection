##Pedestrian Detection

Pedestrian detection is a crucial area of computer vision with significant applications in autonomous vehicles, intelligent traffic systems, and video surveillance.  

* **Accurately identifying pedestrians in images and videos is essential for ensuring safety and enabling real-time decision-making in these domains.**

This project explores the use of Faster R-CNN50, a powerful deep learning model, for pedestrian detection. Faster R-CNN50 leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and localize pedestrians within them.
